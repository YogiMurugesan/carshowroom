    <p>Ravichandran Ashwin burst onto the scene with his street-smart exploits in the shorter form of the game at the IPL, but since his Test debut against West Indies in 2011, Ashwin has made it a habit to pick up wickets, especially in dry and dusty conditions that support turn. He has made a name for himself in the shorter formats of the game, more so in T20 cricket where his accuracy and shrewdness has made him a dependable bowler. He has managed to fill in the boots of Harbhajan Singh and then some, and has become India's premier bowler in the subcontinent.

        A consistent season at the domestic level made him stand out and got Ashwin a contract with the BCCI, in addition to leading Tamil Nadu to victory in the domestic one-day trophy in 2009. When Harbhajan opted out of the first two games against South Africa at home in early 2010, Ashwin was called in as his replacement. Alas he did not get his coveted India Test cap. Impressive performances for the Chennai franchise in the subsequent edition of the IPL meant that he was always knocking on the door and an extended chance arrived in June 2010 when India decided to experiment on their tour to Zimbabwe for a tri-series.
